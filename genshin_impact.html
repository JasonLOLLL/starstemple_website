          In 2020, a new game was released by a Chinese company called MiHoYo.
          The game was titled Genshin Impact and it quickly became one of the
          most popular games in the United States. Jason and I both got hooked
          onto the game. With the game being free to play and costing nothing
          but time, we quickly hopped onto the grind of Genshin Impact.

          Incase you are unfamiliar of what this game Genshin Impact is about,
          take Zelda Breath of the Wild for example and add the anime style. An
          open world game completely for free. The only catch is, its a gatcha
          game. If you don't know what a gatcha game is, it is gambling with an
          in-game currency to get rewards like characters and weapons.

        Now you may be wondering, "Why are these two highschoolers putting a
        page about some anime game?" The answer to that is because it is one of
        the biggest parts of our lives. As players, we have poured hours, and
        money into this game to get to where we are. The only reason why we are
        putting this here is because we need another page and don't know what to
        put other than our favorite game.
