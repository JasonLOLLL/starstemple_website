          When Spencer was little, he wanted to become a mechanical engineer. He
          always wanted to be one. In 2016, Spencer transferred to a new school
          and met a new kid named Jason on the bus. Little did he know that this
          kid would become his best friend. We would eventually do many
          activities together like cubing.

          Spencer told him that he wanted to become a mechanical engineer when
          he grows up. Somehow, this influenced Jason to want to become a
          software engineer. With the school that we go to, Carver Engineering
          and Science, we are offered a lot of opportunities like this one to
          help us reach our goal.
