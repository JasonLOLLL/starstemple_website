        <h2 class="title">About <span>Jason</span></h2>
        <p>
          Hi. My name is Jason Li and I am from Philadelphia. I take great
          interest in STEM especially in the area of technology. This is my
          first attempt at building a website and I appreciate the amount of
          customization. During my middle school days, I got my first PC with
          little experience in the technologies. I enjoyed playing video games
          with my friends which brought me into video editing and graphic design
          for YouTube. I feel like these hobbies are great for me and I would
          like to keep expanding my field further into STEM. This is the reason
          that I am transferring for my junior year in high school; I want to be
          able to reach new opportunities and be the best that I can. I love
          what I do so far and I cannot wait for more.

          <h3>Coding</h3>
          <p>
            I used to make ROBLOX games and I enjoyed the idea of coding. I am
            trying to learn new languages this year like the ones I'm using
            right now: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also want to learn more
            about Python and Java. I find it really cool to be able to create
            amazing applications using my keyboard.

          <h3>Content Creation</h3>
          <p>
            I really enjoy creating content such as videos on YouTube and
            graphic design for profile pictures or banners. This includes
            editing videos when I get the free time. I record myself and friends
            playing video games and then edit it down to make an entertaining
            and funny video for all to enjoy. I find it very fascinating how
            much the powers of technology can achieve.

          <h3>Piano</h3>
          <p>
            I love music. It is such a charm to listen to no matter the mood. To
            display my affection, I started playing the piano almost two years
            ago; it is my favorite instrument. I enjoy playing everything
            ranging from classical music to pop to jazz. Even though I am not
            that experienced, I wish to continue my piano journey so that one
            day I can play my favorite piece,

        <h2 class="title">About <span>Spencer</span></h2>
        <p>
          Hello hello, my name is Spencer and I go to Carver High school for
          Engineering and Science. I thought that this school was a perfect
          choice for me because it as a lot of STEM classes which I am always
          interested in. Because of this school, I am able to partake in events
          like this one. Surprisingly, school is one of the things that I enjoy.
          While I don't enjoy every class, school keeps me from getting bored in
          the middle of the day. I like to do many things in my free time but my
          favorite things I like to do are video editing, cubing, and gaming.
          These three things have made me who I am today.

          <h3>Video Editing</h3>
          <p>
            I like video editing because I always liked seeing a clean final
            product made from the bare clips provided. For the whole 8 months
            that I have had my pc, I had premiere pro and after effects
            installed on my computer. I always found therapy in my creations.

          <h3>Speedcubing</h3>
          <p>
            When I was in 7th grade my friend Jason showed me the Rubik's cube.
            While I had one at home, I never played with it. After seeing how
            swiftly his fingers rotated each layer of the cube, I was intrigued
            and I had to get to where he was. This led me to learn how to solve
            the cube. In one week I was down to 30 seconds. And now I am down to
            20. While I am far from being the fastest in the world, I still like
            cubing to pass the time.

          </div>
          <h3>Keyboards</h3>
          <p>
            I like to customized keyboards for the same reason I like to edit
            videos. When it comes to building a keyboard, I am given a few parts
            like the pcb, the case, the plate mount, and the switches and I have
            to make a keyboard out of them. While I only have one keyboard right
            now, I am looking into investing lots of money into this hobby
            Unfortunately not all keyboards will survive. My most recently built
            keyboard died due to a poor soldering job.

            We knew we had to get started very quickly since we had a late
            start. So, we binged a crash course YouTube video on HTML for 1
            hour. We learned about front-end development which consists mainly
            of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
